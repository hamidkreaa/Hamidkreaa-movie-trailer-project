# Hamidkreaa-movie-trailer-project
First Movie Trailer Website project consists of server-side code to store a list of movies as a web page allowing visitors to review the movies and watch the trailers.
This project was made as part of my Machine Learning Basic Nanodegree.
The basic motivation behind the project was to get a foundations in Programming.
# Usage
Run entertainment_center.py and input the movie titles you want to list on your movie trailer website along with the API Key. Rest is automated by the code.
Rest of the code is documented for further usage. Make sure to remove/modify the footer in fresh_tomatoes.py before the use though.
# Sample Website
